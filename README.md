Project: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

# Project: Dog Breed Classifier

## Overview
This project utilizes a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds. The classifier is built on a deep learning model that has been trained on a diverse dataset of dog images. This README provides essential information to understand, use, and contribute to the project.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Model Details
The image classifier is built on the vgg, resnet and alexnet model architectures, trained on the pet_images and uploaded_images dataset. For additional details on the model architecture and training process, refer to [link to documentation or model details].
